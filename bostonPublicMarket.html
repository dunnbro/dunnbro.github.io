        <h1>Boston Public Market</h1>
        <p>For this hackathon, we were tasked with helping the Boston Public Market to use technology to:
          <ul>
            <li>communicate "local"</li>
            <li>differentiate from competitors such as Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Share the vendors' unique stories</lI>
          </ul>
        </P>
        <p>My team and I started by speaking with several of the vendors to get a firsthand sense of what was working at the market, as well as what could be improved. One problem that we immediately identified was that many customers did not actually realize that everything sold at that market was locally sourced (92% of it from within Massachusetts, and the remainder from elsewhere in New England), despite giving the public an "opportunity to taste, buy, and understand what our region has to offer" being central to the mission of the Market. Several vendors said that customers routinely asked them for foods that were not local, especially fruits and vegetables (limes and watermelons seemed to be the most requested), or out of season. They felt that the Market could do a better job of communicating that only local, seasonal foods were sold there. </p>

        <p>We then examined the Market's web presence to determine whether improvements could be made to more effectively communicate the Market's message to the public. The home page very briefly mentions fresh, locally-sourced food, but most of what a site visitor sees is a feed from the Twitter and Instagram feeds of individual vendors:</p>

        <figure class="img-screenshot">

        </figure>

        <p>This feed certainly contains useful information, but, after looking at the site's Google analytics and noting that it had a relatively high bounce rate of 41% (meaning 41% of site visitors left without viewing any other pages on the site), we decided that the feed belonged in a less prominent place, and that the Market's mission and other more specific information about it should replace it.</p>

         <p>Marketing and promoting is, for the most part, up to each individual vendor, and after some research we realized that many vendors had small, inactive social media presences, or in some cases, no presence at all. We proposed adding a "featured vendor" area to the home page that would frequently refresh, in the hope that some of the less well-known vendors could get some extra attention, and, hopefully, more visitors to their stalls. Along the same lines, we suggested that the Boston Public Market's own social media accounts be used to promote individual vendors, since they had far more followers and subscribers than even the most popular individual vendors. </p>

         <p>We also felt the "Happenings" section could be made more clear. We felt a sidebar that displays specific events with time and date would be more useful, and would clearly communicate that there are multiple events each week that provide unique experiences to "taste, buy, and understand what the region has to offer," in keeping with the Market's mission.</p>

         <p>With these things in mind, I proposed the following redesign to the homepage, which, to summarize, accomplishes the following:
          <ul>
            <li>clearly states the Market's mission, which vendors reported was not clear to many of their customers</li>
            <li>displays a "featured vendor" section to draw attention to lesser-known vendors who might not yet have a strong marketing presence of their own</li>
            <li>clearly displays upcoming events to emphasize the community and educational aspects of the Market</li>
            <li>moves the social media feed to a less prominent, but still very much visible spot on the page, so that those vendors who do have a strong social media presence can amplify their message using the Boston Public Market's comparatively strong web presence</li>
          </ul>
         </p>

        <p>Finally, we recommended adding signage near each entrance to orient the visitor and describe the market's mission. Some customers that I talked to mentioned the sense of mild confusion that they experienced when they first entered the market. Its bustle is certainly a big part of its charm and should in no way be sacrificed, but a simple digital kiosk with a map and basic information, or even a chalkboard and a few paper maps, could go a long way toward making guests feel more welcome. In addition, it would help to differentiate Boston Public Market not only from Whole Foods, but also nearby marketplaces like Faneuil Hall, which has no particular mission or dedication to quality and local sourcing.</p>
